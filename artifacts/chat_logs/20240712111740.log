>[huggingface]: Here's a similar concept:

Concept: [PaymentTransaction] with properties: [id, date, description, type, status, amount, availableBalance, paymentMethod] and behaviors: [getId(), setId(Long), getDate(), setDate(Date), getDescription(), setDescription(String), getType(), setType(String), getStatus(), setStatus(String), getAmount(), setAmount(double), getAvailableBalance(), setAvailableBalance(BigDecimal), getPaymentMethod(), setPaymentMethod(PaymentMethod)]

This concept is similar to SavingsTransaction as it also deals with financial transactions, but it focuses on payment transactions rather than savings transactions. The properties and behaviors are similar, with the addition of a paymentMethod property to specify the method of payment.
