>[huggingface]: Here's a suggestion for a similar concept:

Concept: [WithdrawalTransaction] with properties: [id, date, description, type, status, amount, availableBalance, savingsAccount] and behaviors: [getId(), setId(Long), getDate(), setDate(Date), getDescription(), setDescription(String), getType(), setType(String), getStatus(), setStatus(String), getAmount(), setAmount(double), getAvailableBalance(), setAvailableBalance(BigDecimal), getSavingsAccount(), setSavingsAccount(SavingsAccount)]

This concept is similar to SavingsTransaction as both represent transactions related to a savings account. The properties and behaviors of WithdrawalTransaction are also similar, but with a focus on withdrawals instead of deposits.
