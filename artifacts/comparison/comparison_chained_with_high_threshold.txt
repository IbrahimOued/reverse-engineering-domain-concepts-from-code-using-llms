This concept is similar to SavingsTransaction and CurrentTransaction, as it has similar properties (id, date, description, type, status, amount) and behaviors (getId(), setId(), getDate(), setDate(), etc.). The main difference is that FixedTransaction is associated with a FixedAccount instead of a SavingsAccount or CurrentAccount.
